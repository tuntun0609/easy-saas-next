**Easy SaaS Next** is a SaaS application framework based on Next.js that helps you quickly build a SaaS application.

## Features

- Built with Next.js using TypeScript
- Uses Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI component library (thanks to shadcn/ui's blocks feature, you can easily use a wide range of beautiful components)
- Supports responsive design and dark mode
- Built-in SEO optimization
- Integrates various SaaS services such as database, email, authentication, internationalization, etc.
- Built-in documentation and blog functionality

## Target Audience

Suitable for developers with some development experience. If you're a beginner, you may need to spend some time learning React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

If you're a frontend developer who hasn't worked with backend development before, you might need to spend some time learning Node.js and databases. **Easy SaaS Next** uses Node.js and PostgreSQL as the backend, with [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) as the ORM.

The database defaults to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), but you can choose other databases like [neon](https://neon.tech/).

The framework comes with built-in [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), but you can also choose to use native CSS.
