[fumadocs](https://fumadocs.com/) is a library for building documentation systems.

You can use markdown or mdx to edit documentation. All documentation files are located in the `content/docs` directory.

import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files'

<Files>
  <Folder name="content" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="docs" defaultOpen>
      <File name="index.mdx" />
      <File name="index.en.mdx" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

You can visit `http://localhost:3000/docs` to view the documentation.

## Creating & Editing Documents

You can create a new document by creating an `mdx` (recommended) file. Documents need to follow the [fumadocs](https://fumadocs.com/) specification.

Using `mdx`, you can not only use standard markdown syntax but also React components.

```mdx title="index.mdx"
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

<Button>Click me</Button>
```

All documents need to have `frontmatter` at the top to configure document metadata.

```mdx
---
title: Document Title
description: Document Description
icon: Document Icon
---

Content
```

Available configuration parameters:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | Page title |
| `description` | Page description |
| `icon` | Icon name, using `lucide-react` icons. You only need to select an icon from the [icon list](https://lucide.dev/icons/) and copy the icon name to the icon field. |
| `full` | Fill all available space on the page (Fumadocs UI) |
| `pro` | Whether it's a Pro-exclusive document, only accessible to users who have subscribed to the Pro version; when configured, a `Pro` tag will be displayed next to the article title |

For more details, please refer to the [fumadocs frontmatter](https://fumadocs.dev/docs/headless/page-conventions#file) documentation.

## Internationalization

Easy SaaS Next integrates `i18n` functionality, allowing you to edit documentation in different languages.

To edit English documentation, simply rename the `index.mdx` file to `index.en.mdx`.

## Documentation Directory

The documentation directory is automatically generated based on the files in the `content/docs` directory.

You can create new folders in the `content/docs` directory to generate new documentation directories.

Or customize the structure through `meta.json`, see [fumadocs routing](https://fumadocs.dev/docs/headless/page-conventions) for details.
