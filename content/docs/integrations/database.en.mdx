**Easy SaaS Next** uses [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database and [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) as the ORM.

## Database Configuration

Configure database connection information in the `.env` file.

```bash
# postgres database url
POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://xxxx
```

You can use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) or [neon](https://neon.tech/) as your database provider.

Simply register an account to get the database connection URL. For small applications, a free account can meet your needs.

## Database Code

Database-related code is located in the `src/db` folder.

```ts title="src/db/index.ts"
import 'dotenv/config'

import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js'
import postgres from 'postgres'

import * as schema from './schema'

const connectionString = process.env.POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL!

export const client = postgres(connectionString, { prepare: false })

export const db = drizzle(client, { schema })
```

Database table structures are defined in the `src/db/schema.ts` file.

The default tables include the required table structures for `better-auth` and order-related tables.

import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files'

<Files>
  <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="db" defaultOpen>
      <File name="index.ts" />
      <File name="schema.ts" />
			<File name="auth-schema.ts" />
			<File name="order-schema.ts" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

## Database Migration

Database migration is an essential tool for managing database schema changes. After modifying table structure definitions in the `schema` files, you need to synchronize these changes to the actual database through migration.

### Generate Migration Files

First, generate migration files to record schema changes:

```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit generate
# or use the shorthand command
pnpm db:generate
```

### Apply Migrations

After generating migration files, you can choose one of the following methods to apply changes:

```bash
# Method 1: Directly push schema changes to database (suitable for development environment)
pnpm drizzle-kit push

# Method 2: Execute migration (recommended for production environment)
pnpm drizzle-kit migrate
```

It is recommended to use the `migrate` command in production environments as it handles data migration more safely and maintains migration history.

## Database Visualization

You can use [Drizzle Studio](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview) to visualize the database.

```bash
pnpm db:studio
```
