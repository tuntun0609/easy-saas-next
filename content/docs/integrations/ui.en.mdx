description: Use 100+ open source components in Easy SaaS Next
---

Since **Easy SaaS Next** uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as its UI library, shadcn/ui provides a rich set of components that can meet most scenarios. You can also add various components from the open source community through the [blocks](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/blocks) feature.

**Easy SaaS Next** uses many open source components. Here are some commonly used websites:

- https://magicui.design
- https://ui.aceternity.com
- https://tailark.com
- https://tweakcn.com
- https://originui.com
- https://shadcnui-blocks.com
- https://animate-ui.com/

Usually, you just need to run

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://xxx/xxx.json
```

The component's source code will be automatically added to your project. You can then use these components in your project or add internationalization support for them.
